SHORT DESCRIPTION 
    Information to get started with the RMS Protection tool for an organization
    that uses Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS) data protection. 

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This topic describes how to start using the RMS Protection tool to protect
    or unprotect files if your organization uses the Azure Rights Management
    service from Azure Information Protection. The information includes:
    - Additional prerequisites that are specific to Azure RMS
    - Using RMS Protection cmdlets - example scenarios


  PREREQUISITES:
      In addition to any prerequisites for the RMS Protection tool (see 
      RMS Protection Cmdlets on MSDN 
      - https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt433195.aspx) there are 
      additional prerequisite for Azure RMS: 
 
      1: The Azure Rights Management service must be activated
      2: To unprotect files for others using your own account: The
         super user feature must be enabled for your organization and your 
         account must be configured to be a super user for Azure RMS.
      3: To protect or unprotect files without interaction: Create a service 
         principal account, run Set-RMSServerAuthentication, and consider
         making this service principal a super user for Azure RMS.
      4: For regions outside North America: Edit the registry.

      For the first prerequisite, if your Azure Information Protection tenant is not
      activated, see the instructions for Activating Azure Rights Management
      (https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/deploy-use/activate-service)
      on the Microsoft documentation site.

      For the second prerequisite, see "Configuring super users for 
      Azure Rights Management and Discovery Services or Data Recovery" 
      (https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/deploy-use/configure-super-users)
      on the Microsoft documentation site.

      For the third prerequisite, to use the cmdlets without user interaction
      you must authenticate with the Azure RMS service by using a service principal,
      which you do by using the Set-RMSServerAuthentication cmdlet. You must do this
      for each Windows PowerShell session that runs cmdlets that contact the 
      Azure RMS service. Before you run this cmdlet, make sure that you have
      these three identifiers:

      - BposTenantId
      - AppPrincipalId
      - Symmetric Key
    
    To get BposTenantId: 
    - Run the Get-AadrmConfiguration cmdlet from the Azure RMS 
      Windows PowerShell module:

    1. If this module is not already installed on your computer, see 
       Installing Windows PowerShell for Azure Rights Management 
       (https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/deploy-use/install-powershell)

    2. Start Windows PowerShell with the Run as Administrator option. 

    3. Use the Connect-AadrmService cmdlet to connect to the Azure RMS service: 
           C:\PS> Connect-AadrmService

       When prompted, enter your Azure Information Protection tenant
       administrator credentials (typically, you will use an account that is a
       global administrator for Azure Active Directory or Office 365).

    4. Run Get-AadrmConfiguration and make a copy of the BPOSId value.
       The following is an example of output from Get-AadrmConfiguration

       C:\PS> Get-AadrmConfiguration

       BPOSId                                   : 23976bc6-dcd4-4173-9d96-dad1f48efd42
       RightsManagement ServiceId               : 1a302373-f233-440600909-4cdf305e2e76
       LicensingIntranetDistributionPointUrl    : https://1s302373-f233-4406-9090-4cdf30
                                                  5e2e76.rms.na.aadrm.com/_wmcs/licensing
       LicensingExtranetDistributionPointUrl    : https://1s302373-f233-4406-9090-4cdf305e
                                                  2e76.rms.na.aadrm.com/_wmcs/licensing
       CertificationIntranetDistributionPointUrl: https://1s302373-f233-4406-9090-4cdf305e
                                                  2e76.rms.na.aadrm.com/_wmcs/certification 
       CertificationExtranetDistributionPointUrl: https://1s302373-f233-4406-9090-4cdf305e
                                                  2e76.rms.na.aadrm.com/_wmcs/certification 
    6. Disconnect from the service: 
         C:\PS>Disconnect-AadrmService 

    To get AppPrincipalId and Symmetric Key: 
    - Run the New-MsolServicePrincipal cmdlet from the Azure Active Directory
      module:

    1. If this module is not already installed on your computer, see 
       Install the Azure AD Module 
       (https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj151815.aspx#bkmk_installmodule).

    2. Start Windows PowerShell with the Run as Administrator option. 

    3. Use the Connect-MsolService cmdlet to connect to Azure AD: 
           C:\PS> Connect-MsolService
       When prompted, enter your Azure AD tenant administrator 
       credentials (typically, you will use an account that is a global 
       administrator for Azure Active Directory or Office 365).

    4. Run the New-MsolServicePrincipal cmdlet to create a new 
       service principal: 
           C:\PS> New-MsolServicePrincipal

       When prompted, enter your choice of a display name for this
       service principal that will help you identify its purpose later as 
       an account for you to connect to the Azure Rights Management service so
       that you can protect and unprotect files.

       An example of the output of New-MsolServicePrincipal is shown here:
       
           Supply values for the following parameters: 
           DisplayName: AzureRMSProtectionServicePrincipal 
           The following symmetric key was created as one was not supplied 
           zIeMu8zNJ6U377CLtppkhkbl4gjodmYSXUVwAO5ycgA=

           Display Name: AzureRMSProtectionServicePrincipal
           ServicePrincipalNames: (b5e3f7g1-b5c2-4c96-a594-a0807f65bba4)
           ObjectId: 23720996-593c-4122-bfc7-1abb5a0b5109
           AppPrincialId: b5e3f76a-b5c2-4c96-a594-a0807f65bba4
           TrustedForDelegation: False
           AccountEnabled: True
           Addresses: ()
           KeyType: Symmetric
           KeyId: 8ef61651-ca11-48ea-a350-25834a1ba17c
           StartDate: 3/7/2014 4:43:59 AM
           EndDate: 3/7/2014 4:43:59 AM
           Usage: Verify

    5. From this output, make a note of the symmetric key and the AppPrincialId. 

       It is particularly important that you make a copy of the symmetric key
       because you cannot retrieve it in full later so if you do not know it,
       you will have to create a new service principal the next time you need 
       to authenticate to the Azure Rights Management service.

    From these instructions and our examples, we have the three identifiers
    required to run Set-RMSServerAuthentication:
    * Tenant Id: 23976bc6-dcd4-4173-9d96-dad1f48efd42
    * Symmetric key: zIeMu8zNJ6U377CLtppkhkbl4gjodmYSXUVwAO5ycgA=
    * AppPrincipalId: b5e3f76a-b5c2-4c96-a594-a0807f65bba4

    Our example command would then look like this:
        C:\PS> Set-RMSServerAuthentication
        -Key zIeMu8zNJ6U377CLtppkhkbl4gjodmYSXUVwAO5ycgA=
        -AppPrincipalId b5e3f76a-b5c2-4c96-a594-a0807f65bba4
        -BposTenantId 23976bc6-dcd4-4173-9d96-dad1f48efd42

    As shown in the previous command, you can supply the values with a single
    command, or just type Set-RMSServerAuthentication, and supply the values
    one-by-one when prompted. When the command completes, you see 
    "The RmsServerAuthentication is set to ON", which means you can now protect
    and unprotect files by using your service principal.

    Consider making this service principal a super user: To ensure that this 
    service principal can always unprotect files for others, it can be configured
    to be a super user. In the same way as you configure a standard user account 
    to be a super user, you use the same Azure RMS cmdlet, Add-AadrmSuperUser
    (https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn629411.aspx) but specify the 
    -ServicePrincipalId parameter with your AppPrincipalId value.  

    For more information about super users, see "Configuring super users for 
    Azure Rights Management and discovery services or data recovery" 
    (https://docs.microsoft.com/information-protection/deploy-use/configure-super-users)
    on the Microsoft documentation site.

    Note: To use your own account to authenticate to the Azure Rights Management
    service, there's no need to run Set-RMSServerAuthentication before you
    protect or unprotect files, or get templates. 
    
    Finally, for the fourth prerequisite for authentication outside the Azure 
    North America region, you must edit the registry as follows (if your Azure
    Information Protection tenant is in North America, do not do this step):

    1. Run the Get-AadrmConfiguration cmdlet again, and make a note of the
       values for CertificationExtranetDistributionPointUrl and
       LicensingExtranetDistributionPointUrl

    2. On each computer where you will run the RMS Protection cmdlets, open the
       registry editor and navigate to:
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSIPC
          
    3. If you do not see the ServiceLocation key, create it, so that your
       registry path shows
       HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSIPC\ServiceLocation
          
    4. For the ServiceLocation key, create two keys if they do not exist, named
       EnterpriseCertification and EnterprisePublishing. When you create these
       REG_SZ keys, do not change the Name of "(Default)", but edit them to set 
       the Value data: 
       - For EnterpriseCertification, paste your 
         CertificationExtranetDistributionPointUrl value.
       - For EnterprisePublishing, paste your
         LicensingExtranetDistributionPointUrl value.

    5. Close the registry editor. There is no need to restart your computer. However,
       if you are using a service principal account rather than your own user account,
       you must run the Set-RMSServerAuthentication command after making this registry
       edit.

  USING RMS PROTECTION CMDLETS - EXAMPLE SCENARIOS
      A typical scenario for these cmdlets is to protect all files in a folder
      by using a rights policy template, or to unprotect a file. 

      First, only if you need to authenticate to the Azure Rights Management service
      with a service principal rather than use your own account, type:

        C:\PS> Set-RMSServerAuthentication

      When prompted, enter the three identifiers as described in the
      prerequisites section. 

      Before you can protect files, you need to get a list of Rights Management
      templates to identify which one to use and its corresponding ID number. From the
      output, you can then copy the template ID:

        C:\PS> Get-RMSTemplate

           TemplateId        : {82bf3474-6efe-4fa1-8827-d1bd93339119}
           CultureInfo       : en-US
           Description       : This content is proprietary information intended for 
                               internal users only. This content cannot be modified.
           Name              : Contoso, Ltd - Confidential View Only
           IssuerDisplayName : Contoso, Ltd
           FromTemplate      : True


           TemplateId        : {e6ee2481-26b9-45e5-b34a-f744eacd53b0}
           CultureInfo       : en-US
           Description       : This content is proprietary information intended for 
                               internal users only. This content can be modified but 
                               cannot be copied and printed.
           Name              : Contoso, Ltd - Confidential
           IssuerDisplayName : Contoso, Ltd
           FromTemplate      : True
           FromTemplate      : True

     Note that if you didn't run the Set-RMSServerAuthentication command, you will be 
     authenticated to the Azure Rights Management service by using your own user 
     account. If you are on a domain-joined computer, your current credentials will
     always be used automatically. If you are on a workgroup computer, you will be
     prompted to sign in to Azure and these credentials are then cached for subsequent
     commands. In this scenario, if you later need to sign in as a different user, use
     the Clear-RMSAuthentication cmdlet.
    
     Now you know the template ID, you can use it with the Protect-RMSFile
     cmdlet to protect a single file or all files in a folder. For example, if
     you want to protect a single file only and overwrite the original, by using the 
     "Contoso, Ltd - Confidential" template:

          C:\PS> Protect-RMSFile -File C:\Test.docx -InPlace -TemplateId e6ee2481-26b9-45e5-b34a-f744eacd53b0

          InputFile             EncryptedFile
          ---------             -------------
          C:\Test.docx          C:\Test.docx   
 
      To protect all files in a folder, use the -Folder parameter with a drive
      letter and path, or UNC path. For example:

          C:\PS> Protect-RMSFile -Folder \\Server1\Documents -InPlace -TemplateId e6ee2481-26b9-45e5-b34a-f744eacd53b0

          InputFile                          EncryptedFile
          ---------                          -------------
          \\Server1\Documents\Test1.docx     \\Server1\Documents\Test1.docx   
          \\Server1\Documents\Test2.docx     \\Server1\Documents\Test2.docx   
          \\Server1\Documents\Test3.docx     \\Server1\Documents\Test3.docx   
          \\Server1\Documents\Test4.docx     \\Server1\Documents\Test4.docx   

      When the file name extension does not change after RMS protection is
      applied, you can always use the Get-RMSFileStatus cmdlet later to check
      whether the file is protected. For example: 

          C:\PS> Get-RMSFileStatus -File \\Server1\Documents\Test1.docx

          FileName                              Status
          --------                              ------
          \\Server1\Documents\Test1.docx         Protected

      To unprotect a file, you must have Owner or Extract rights from when the
      file was protected, or you must be running the cmdlets as a super user. Then, 
      use the Unprotect cmdlet. For example:

          C:\PS> Unprotect-RMSFile C:\test.docx -InPlace

          InputFile                             DecryptedFile
          ---------                             -------------
          C:\Test.docx                          C:\Test.docx


   For more information about any of the RMS Protection module cmdlets, use the
   Get-Help <cmdlet name> cmdlet, where <cmdlet name> is the name of the cmdlet
   that you want to research. For example:

       C:\PS> Get-Help Get-RMSTemplate
